Import the .csv file to your Twitter account for an improved experience.
Use the .html file to cross reference the user id number for selective editing.

Twitter doesn't include the real name with the id in their .csv block-lists so I extracted the html from their confirmation modal window and included it unmolested.

TODO:
Modal confirmation window scraping script.
Script for automatically adding Verified Corporate Twitter Accounts to the block-list.
Political Red vs. Blue version.
